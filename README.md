# Environment-Monitor
This is a project for Microprocessor and Embedded Systems Laboratory. An environment monitor was built that provides temperature, humidity and air quality at a certain instant. There are two sensors in this project. One of the sensors provide temperature and humidity readings and the other sensor provides the air quality of that certain place. The presentation file contains the hardware setup as well as the demonstration of the project.
